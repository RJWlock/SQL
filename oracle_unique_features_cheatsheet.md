# Unique Oracle SQL & PL/SQL Features Cheat Sheet

This document covers powerful features unique to Oracle that are useful in both APEX and general database development.

---

## 🧱 PL/SQL Blocks

Oracle's procedural extension to SQL. Used in triggers, dynamic actions, and stored logic.

```sql
DECLARE
  v_name VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
  SELECT name INTO v_name FROM employees WHERE id = 101;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_name);
END;
```

---

## 📄 Dual Table

A one-row, one-column table useful for testing expressions.

```sql
SELECT SYSDATE FROM dual;
SELECT 1 + 1 FROM dual;
```

---

## 🔁 Sequences

Oracle's way to auto-generate unique IDs.

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE emp_seq START WITH 1000 INCREMENT BY 1;
SELECT emp_seq.NEXTVAL FROM dual;
```

---

## 🔢 ROWNUM and ROWID

- `ROWNUM`: Row numbering for filtering.
- `ROWID`: Unique physical row address.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

---

## 🔄 MERGE Statement (UPSERT)

Efficient insert/update operation.

```sql
MERGE INTO employees e
USING temp_employees t
ON (e.id = t.id)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET e.salary = t.salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, name, salary) VALUES (t.id, t.name, t.salary);
```

---

## 🧠 %TYPE and %ROWTYPE

Dynamic typing based on table structure.

```sql
v_salary employees.salary%TYPE;
emp_record employees%ROWTYPE;
```

---

## ⚠️ Exception Handling

Handle errors with custom logic.

```sql
BEGIN
  -- code
EXCEPTION
  WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Not found');
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(SQLERRM);
END;
```

---

## 🧾 Autonomous Transactions

Allows a procedure to commit independently.

```sql
PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
```

---

## 🔗 APEX Bind Variables

Reference APEX page items.

```sql
:P1_USER_ID
```

---

## ⏱ DBMS_SCHEDULER

Schedule jobs in the background.

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB(...);
```

---

## 🧮 Virtual Columns

Define computed columns in a table.

```sql
full_name AS (first_name || ' ' || last_name)
```

---

## 🕒 Flashback Queries

Query data as it existed in the past.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees AS OF TIMESTAMP (SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE);
```

---

## 📦 User-Defined Types (UDTs)

Create structured data types.

```sql
CREATE TYPE address_type AS OBJECT (
  street VARCHAR2(100),
  city   VARCHAR2(50)
);
```

---

## 📚 PL/SQL Collections

Oracle arrays and tables.

```sql
TYPE id_array IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
```

---

## 🧠 Materialized Views

Stored and refreshable result sets.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees REFRESH FAST AS
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

## ⚙️ Optional Advanced Features

- Context variables: `USER`, `SYSDATE`, `CURRENT_SCHEMA`
- `DBMS_METADATA`: Get DDL for any object
- Invisible columns
- Partitioning
- Edition-based redefinition

## 📦 Oracle Packages (Oracle-Specific Feature)

Oracle Packages are a powerful, **Oracle-exclusive** feature of PL/SQL that allow developers to group related procedures, functions, variables, constants, cursors, and exceptions into a **modular unit**.

### 🧱 Why Use Packages?

| Feature             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Modularity**      | Group related logic (e.g., utility functions) into a single unit. |
| **Encapsulation**   | Hide implementation details; expose only what's needed via the specification. |
| **Reusability**     | Call package contents from anywhere in your application. |
| **Performance**     | Loaded once into memory — faster than standalone procedures/functions. |
| **Security**        | You can grant access at the package level rather than item by item. |

### 🧰 Package Structure

A package has two parts:

1. **Specification** – Public interface (what other code can see and call).
2. **Body** – Private logic (actual implementation).

### ✍️ Example

#### 🔹 Specification
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE my_utils AS
  FUNCTION get_username(p_user_id NUMBER) RETURN VARCHAR2;
  PROCEDURE log_action(p_action VARCHAR2);
END my_utils;
```

#### 🔹 Body
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY my_utils AS

  FUNCTION get_username(p_user_id NUMBER) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
    v_name VARCHAR2(100);
  BEGIN
    SELECT username INTO v_name FROM users WHERE user_id = p_user_id;
    RETURN v_name;
  END;

  PROCEDURE log_action(p_action VARCHAR2) IS
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO action_log (action, logged_at) VALUES (p_action, SYSDATE);
  END;

END my_utils;
```

### ▶️ How to Call

```sql
-- In SQL:
SELECT my_utils.get_username(101) FROM dual;

-- In PL/SQL:
BEGIN
  my_utils.log_action('User login');
END;
```

### ❗ Oracle-Only Feature

| Feature                     | Oracle | PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server |
|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------|
| Grouped procedures/functions in one unit | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Public/private scoping within a DB object | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Memory-loaded modules for performance | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Function/procedure overloading in a package | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

*Packages are one of Oracle PL/SQL's most powerful and unique offerings. No direct equivalent exists in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.*

## 🚀 Additional Oracle-Only Features (Advanced)

These powerful features are exclusive to Oracle and useful in advanced database design, security, and performance optimization.

---

### 🧭 Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR)

Supports **zero-downtime upgrades** by allowing multiple versions of packages, views, and synonyms.

```sql
-- Switch to a different edition (code version) at the session level
ALTER SESSION SET EDITION = my_new_edition;
```

- Enables hot deployment of application changes.
- Useful in large-scale enterprise systems.

---

### 🧠 Result Cache

Oracle can cache the results of SQL or PL/SQL function calls to improve performance.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_product_name(p_id NUMBER)
RETURN VARCHAR2
RESULT_CACHE
IS
  v_name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
  SELECT name INTO v_name FROM products WHERE product_id = p_id;
  RETURN v_name;
END;
```

- Automatically caches and reuses query results.
- Great for read-heavy operations.

---

### 🧱 Index-Organized Tables (IOTs)

Tables where data is stored within a **B-tree index**, not as a separate heap.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  name   VARCHAR2(50)
) ORGANIZATION INDEX;
```

- Faster access for primary key lookups.
- Ideal for small, lookup-heavy tables.

---

### 🗃 Global Temporary Tables (GTTs)

Temporary tables scoped to a **session or transaction** — data is automatically purged.

```sql
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_orders (
  order_id NUMBER,
  product_id NUMBER
) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS;
```

- Data is private to each session.
- Useful for intermediate results or large calculations.

---

### 🔐 Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC)

Also known as **Row-Level Security**, this restricts data visibility per user without changing application code.

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_RLS.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema    => 'HR',
    object_name      => 'EMPLOYEES',
    policy_name      => 'emp_policy',
    function_schema  => 'HR',
    policy_function  => 'fn_limit_access'
  );
END;
```

- Automatically filters rows based on session context or user.
- Powerful for multi-tenant or secure systems.

---

### 🏗 Multi-Tenant Architecture (CDB/PDB)

Oracle supports multiple **pluggable databases (PDBs)** inside one **container database (CDB)**.

- Share infrastructure while isolating workloads.
- Manage many applications under a single Oracle instance.

```sql
-- Example: switch to a pluggable database
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = pdb1;
```

---

These features are exclusive to Oracle Enterprise-grade environments and are key differentiators for high-availability, secure, and scalable solutions.
